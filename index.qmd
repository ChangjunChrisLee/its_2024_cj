## What is Digital Transformation?

<hr>

> **DT (Digital Transformation)** is the application of digital technology
> to all areas of business.

-   These fundamental changes will change how we operate our business and
    deliver value to our customers. It forces us to fundamentally rethink
    our methods.

-   This is not a simple technological change, but rather an organization
    that continuously challenges the status quo. A cultural shift that
    requires experimentation and getting comfortable with failure.

-   Fundamental paradigm shift from traditional business methods and
    processes

<br>

## Motivation

<hr>

-   Unlike manufacturing, where various technologies are integrated and
    digitalization is progressing rapidly, [**Digital transformation in the
    service industry progresses slowly**]{.underline}

    -   South Korea’s service industry has a structural problem of low
        productivity and small-sized scale. The problem is that it is
        somewhat far from technological innovation.

-   However, due to COVID-19, **digital transformation has emerged as a
    matter of survival, not a choice**, and various DT attempts are
    underway in the service industry, starting with some fields and some
    companies.

    -   **Technology-based companies emerge and digitalization progresses**
        to apply digital technology in various service fields (Musinsa,
        Masspresso (Qanda), Bucket Place (Today's House), etc.)

    -   With the integration of digital technology, data is collected and
        accumulated, service methods are changing and new possibilities are
        opening up.

-   In order to utilize the digital transformation as our opportunity,
    **research is needed to diagnose and promote the digital transformation
    of the service industry**

    -   Since DT is a field where a lot of [innovation through new business
        models within the startup ecosystem]{.underline} occurs, [analysis
        of startup ecosystem dynamics is needed]{.underline}

## Why is DT Industry Classification Difficult?

<hr>

1.  **Various degrees of digital maturity**

    -   Different industries, and even businesses within the same industry,
        exist at different stages of digital maturity (e.g. finance,
        manufacturing, retail, healthcare, etc.)
    -   A one-size-fits-all classification system is likely to misrepresent
        these variations.

2.  **Rapid advancement in technology**

    -   The digital environment is changing rapidly (recent AI wave)

    -   Technological innovations continue to change the nature and scope
        of digital transformation, rapidly obsolete fixed classification
        systems.

## Why is DT Industry Classification Difficult? (Cont.)

<hr>

1.  **Other DT approaches**

    -   Even companies in the same industry may have greatly different
        approaches to DT.

    -   e.g.) Greater emphasis on face-to-face services in finance,
        introduction of AI to improve customer experience **vs.**
        Innovation in payment systems or asset management methods through
        introduction of blockchain

2.  **Unique Business Model**

    -   Digital innovation continues to create new and unique business
        models that defy traditional industry classifications (mutation).

    -   e.g.) Mobility (or Housing) sharing

## Research Goal

<hr>

<br>

-   **Development of a frame for digital transformation ecosystem
    analysis**

    -   **Industry:** Digital transformation industry classification

    -   **Technology convergence:** Analysis of digital transformation
        business model and technology convergence trends

    -   **Organization:** Analysis of organizational dynamics of digital
        transformation companies

<br>

-   Development of **investment attraction prediction model** using **three
    frames** of **industry, technology convergence, and organization**

    -   Comparison of investment attraction prediction models and
        performance evaluation

    -   Exploring key factors influencing investment attraction in the
        digital transformation ecosystem

## Digital transformation ‘industry’ classification

<hr>

**Topic modelling**

> A kind of [statistical modeling]{.underline} to discover abstract
> ["topics"]{.underline} that occur in a collection of documents.

<br>

**LDA** (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

> LDA is a generative probability model that assumes that each chunk of
> text (e.g. a document or sentence) is a mixture of a specific set of
> topics and that each word in a document is attributed to one of the
> topics in the document.

## Digital transformation ‘industry’ classification

<hr>

**DT ecosystem industry classification using topic modeling**

-   Topic modeling is used to classify industries within a digital
    ecosystem where business models and technologies are integrated.

-   Assumptions of topic modeling: A document exists as a distribution of
    multiple topics, and a topic exists as a distribution of multiple
    sentences (words).

    -   Document: Company

    -   Sentence (word): Sentence (word, keyword) that describes the
        company

    -   Topic: Industry

## Topic modeling (LDA details) {.scrollable}

<hr>

The LDA model aims to find:

-   **Document to Topic distributions**: How likely each topic is for each
    document.

-   **Topic to Word distributions**: How likely each word is for each
    topic.

<br>

Mathematically, these distributions can be represented as follows:

-   **Document to Topic distribution**: For each document $d$, there's a
    multinomial distribution over topics $θ_d$.

$$
θ_d \sim Dirichlet(α)
$$

> Here, $α$ is a K-dimensional vector, where K is the number of topics.

$$
θ_d \sim \beta_1 Topic_1 + \beta_2 Topic_2 + ... + \beta_k Topic_k
$$

<br>

-   **Topic to Word distribution**: For each topic $k$, there's a
    multinomial distribution over words $β_k$.

$$
β_k \sim Dirichlet(δ)
$$

> Here, $δ$ is a W-dimensional vector, where W is the number of words in
> the vocabulary.

$$
β_k \sim \gamma_1 Word_1 + \gamma_2 Word_2 + ...+ \gamma_k Word_k
$$

<br>

Given these distributions, each word $w_{di}$ in each document $d$ is
generated in the following way:

-   Choose a topic $z_{di}$ from the document's multinomial distribution of
    topics.

$$
z_{di} \sim Multinomial(θ_d)
$$

<br>

-   Choose a word from the topic's multinomial distribution of words.

$$
w_{di} \sim Multinomial(β_{z_{di}})
$$

<br>

The goal is to learn the hidden topic structure $θ_d$ and $β_k$ that likely
generated the observed collection of documents.

## Investment stage distribution by industry {.scrollable}

<hr>

-   Investment timing, investment round, and investment field are different
    for each VC.

-   When money flows in (investment occurs), a new market is formed and
    grows together.

-   We want to look at the timing of investment in order to predict what
    new market will be formed in the future.

-   Investments at the SEED (\~300 million) and Pre-A (5\~1 billion) stages
    are at the stage of growing the market.

## Industrial ecosystem ‘Tech-BM’ convergence analysis through knowledge structure analysis

<hr>

### knowledge Structure

-   Knowledge structures represent the organization and distribution of
    knowledge within different economic activities and **geographic
    locations**

-   Involves understanding how knowledge is created, shared and utilized
    across different sectors of the economy and how it is influenced by
    spatial factors.

-   Examines spatial patterns of knowledge production, innovation and
    diffusion, considering factors such as proximity, connectivity and
    accessibility

-   Knowledge clusters or innovation hubs emerge in specific geographic
    areas where knowledge-intensive activities are concentrated, such as
    technology parks or research centers.

-   Knowledge spillover occurs when knowledge created in one location or
    industry spills over to benefit another location or industry, leading
    to an agglomeration effect.

-   The geography of knowledge is influenced by factors such as investment
    in research and development (R&D), educational institutions,
    availability of skilled labor and infrastructure.

-   Local and regional knowledge assets, including human capital, social
    networks and institutions, play an important role in attracting and
    sustaining knowledge-based industries.

-   The spatial composition of knowledge also affects regional disparities,
    as regions with higher knowledge intensity tend to experience greater
    economic development and innovation than regions with lower knowledge
    intensity.

## Connection, weighted connection, mediation, power, and closeness centrality in `Biz-Tech` space {.scrollable}

<hr>

-   **Degree**: The number of other nodes in a graph to which a node is
    directly connected: can indirectly indicate the importance of that node
    in the graph

-   **Weighted Degree**: In a weighted graph, the weighted connection of a
    node represents the sum of the weights of connected edges: the degree
    of connection of a node considering the 'strength' or 'importance' of
    the edge.

-   **Betweenness Centrality**: Indicates how often they appear on the
    shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the graph: nodes with high
    betweenness centrality act as 'bridges' in the flow of information

-   **Eigenvector Centrality**: The power centrality of a node takes into
    account the importance of other nodes directly connected to that node:
    nodes that are more connected to important nodes have higher power
    centrality.

-   **Closeness Centrality**: The closeness centrality of a node indicates
    how 'close' it is to all other nodes in the graph: where 'closer'
    refers to the path length between nodes, i.e. the shorter the distance
    between nodes, the higher the closeness centrality. .

    -   Problem of not fitting into the existing industry classification
        framework

    -   Problems that cannot be addressed through patent analysis, such as
        in manufacturing, for technology convergence analysis

<br>

-   Attempt to classify industries within a new industrial ecosystem using
    **topic modeling**

    -   [Try to show the Convergence of technology and business
        models]{.underline} outside of the existing framework clustering

    -   Attempt to [automate the business classification
        process]{.underline} leading to ML and Generative AI

    -   Really effective in analyzing new industrial ecosystems

    -   Tags, investments, buzz analysis, etc. for each business were
        possible.

-   **Knowledge structure analysis** of DT ecosystem

    -   Through data provided by the 'Innovation Forest' venture company
        information platform, we were able to derive the degree of
        correlation between technologies by analyzing how 419 unique tags
        (technology/business/product/service) appear simultaneously.

    -   Visualize the technology space of the digital transformation
        technology venture ecosystem based on this correlation information

    -   Through the position of each node (tag or technology) in the
        technology space, which detailed technology in the digital
        transformation technology space is fused with other technologies to
        create a new technology, mediates other technology groups, or is
        applied to multiple technology groups. I was able to find out.

    -   Create a separate technology space for each industry classified
        through topic modeling and confirm that the positions of
        technologies within it can also be analyzed.

## Discussion

<hr>

-   Development of investment (VC) attraction prediction model

    -   Industry, Biz-Tech convergence, organization: deriving a framework
        for three perspectives

    -   As a result of training in period T and testing in period T+1, the
        performance was [accuracy of over 70% and investment success rate
        of 65%]{.underline}

-   Key factors affecting investment attraction predictions

    -   **Organization \> Convergence \> Industry**

    -   [Confirmed that organizational dynamics can be a good signal for
        investment decisions]{.underline}

    -   Among the positions of Biz-Tech convergence, [the mediation,
        connection, and proximity centrality of tags owned by a
        company]{.underline} can also be a decisive factor in deciding
        investment.

-   When to invest

    -   When you get +1 or +2 from 3\~4 employees

    -   Or, when the organization's in_ratio is slightly higher than its
        out_ratio

    -   At the same time, companies with high mediation, weighting, and
        proximity centrality of their tags

## Future study

<hr>

-   Industry Classificaiton

    -   Comparison of topic models and traditional classification methods

-   Biz-Tech convergence part

    -   Research on the meaning of centrality

    -   Find ways to measure factors affecting investment factors more
        specifically

-   Organization factors

    -   Theoretical discussion on in & out dynamics
